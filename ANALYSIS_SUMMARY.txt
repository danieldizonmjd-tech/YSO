TEST COORDINATE STATUS
================================================================================

User-Specified Coordinate:
  RA  = 325.348403°
  Dec = +65.927139°

Status: OUTSIDE NEOWISE Catalog Coverage
  Reason: Declination (+65.9°) exceeds NEOWISE catalog maximum (±62.24°)

Recommendation: 
  → Use this coordinate to TEST ZTF query system
  → Query surrounding sky area for any ZTF lightcurves
  → Validate ZTF API response before running full catalog queries

Nearby Alternative Coordinates (within ~1° radius):
  Several NEOWISE sources identified nearby in RA
  Alternative: Query sources immediately south of this declination

================================================================================
ZTF QUERY STRATEGY
================================================================================

PHASE 1: VALIDATION (Priority = IMMEDIATE)
─────────────────────────────────────────
□ Test ZTF API with provided coordinate: (325.348403, +65.927139)
  - Verify API response time and format
  - Assess lightcurve availability in this sky region
  - Document query performance

□ Test with sample NEOWISE sources from test list
  - Query first 5-10 sources
  - Assess detection rates
  - Evaluate photometric data quality

Target: Establish baseline performance metrics

PHASE 2: VARIABLE SOURCES (Priority = HIGH)
────────────────────────────────────────────
□ Query Paper 2 Variable Sources: 5,444 targets
  - Focus on "Irregular" type (4,103 sources)
  - Expected detection rate: 25-35%
  - Expected lightcurves: ~1,000-1,400 sources

  • Already show mid-IR variability
  • Likely to correlate with optical variability
  • Excellent for comparing timescales

PHASE 3: YOUNG SYSTEMS (Priority = HIGH)
─────────────────────────────────────────
□ Query Paper 3 H-alpha Sources: 3,470 targets
  - All spectroscopically confirmed young systems
  - Expected detection rate: 30-50%
  - Expected lightcurves: ~1,000-1,700 sources

Rationale:
  • H-alpha emission indicates active accretion
  • Known to be young and variable
  • Unbiased spectroscopic selection

PHASE 4: BURSTS & OUTBURSTS (Priority = MEDIUM)
───────────────────────────────────────────────
□ Query Paper 2 Burst Sources: 228 targets
  - Known infrared outburst events
  - Expected detection rate: 60-80%
  - Search for optical counterparts and timing

PHASE 5: CONTROL SAMPLE (Priority = MEDIUM)
─────────────────────────────────────────────
□ Query sample of non-variable sources
  - Paper 2 NV sources: every 20th source (~760 targets)
  - Assess contamination/background
  - Establish variability threshold

OPTICAL VISIBILITY ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

PAPER 2 NEOWISE SOURCES
─────────────────────

Optical Visibility Likelihood by Type:

1. Irregular Variables (4,103 sources)
   Status: ✓ EXCELLENT candidates for ZTF
   Optical Expected: HIGH
   Rationale: Erratic mid-IR changes likely reflect accretion fluctuations
   Estimated Detection: 25-35% in ZTF

2. Curved/Trending (586 sources)
   Status: ✓ EXCELLENT candidates for ZTF
   Optical Expected: HIGH
   Rationale: Smooth trends may represent secular evolution
   Estimated Detection: 40-60% in ZTF

3. Burst Events (228 sources)
   Status: ✓ EXCELLENT candidates for ZTF
   Optical Expected: VERY HIGH
   Rationale: Outburst events typically visible across all wavelengths
   Estimated Detection: 60-80% in ZTF

4. Periodic Sources (190 sources)
   Status: ✓ EXCELLENT candidates for ZTF
   Optical Expected: MODERATE-HIGH
   Rationale: Periodic mid-IR may indicate rotation/binarity
   Estimated Detection: 50-70% in ZTF

5. Linear Trends (215 sources)
   Status: ✓ GOOD candidates for ZTF
   Optical Expected: MODERATE-HIGH
   Estimated Detection: 40-60% in ZTF

6. Drop Events (122 sources)
   Status: ✓ GOOD candidates for ZTF
   Optical Expected: MODERATE-HIGH

PAPER 3 LAMOST H-ALPHA SOURCES
──────────────────────────────

Optical Visibility:  ✓ EXCELLENT
Status: All sources are spectroscopically confirmed young systems
H-alpha Indicator: Active accretion/mass outflows
Optical Expected: HIGH variability probability

Reasons for Optical Variability:
  1. Accretion-driven variability (H-alpha indicates ongoing accretion)
  2. Disk instabilities (common in young systems)
  3. Stellar rotation (if visible through surface features)
  4. Episodic accretion/outbursts (FUor/EXor types)

Estimated Detection: 30-50% in ZTF
